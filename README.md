# IMPROVED VEHICLE COUNTING AND CLASSIFICATION ON MONOCLUAR TRAFFIC VIDEO SEQUENCES
This project is a computer vision based vehicle counting system. The system is capable of performing vehicle detetcion, tracking, counting, classification (into light medium and heavy), speed estimation and traffic flow estimation. It harnesses the power of computer vision to get deeper insights into our traffic. The focus is on development of vehicle counting techniques and their comparative analysis on datasets.
